# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
- I'd like to make a pixelated video game with Persona characters.
- But it would be a fighting game, like an arcade game with jabs and combos.
- I was also thinking that I could make a discord bot. 
- That seems pretty cool to make, with all the different responses and stuff.
- Or maybe I can make a video game with my own characters, instead of a fan game.
- Not just characters that I borrowed from studio Atlus.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
I don't plan to collaborate with anyone. I'm working on this project myself.

## Do you have any questions of your own?
- How long should the project be if I chose to make a game? 
- Is there anything considered too advanced to be made? 
- What kind of games are the best games to make with Python?
